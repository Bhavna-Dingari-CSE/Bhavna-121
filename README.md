The purpose of looking into "Technology and Its Impact on Daily Life" is to see how technology changes the way we live, interact, and spend our time every day. We want to find out both the good and bad sides of technologyâ€”like how it can make life easier but also cause distractions or stress. By understanding these effects, we hope to help people think more carefully about how they use technology and find a better balance in their lives.
